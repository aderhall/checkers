# Checkers
A work-in-progress checkers opponent I'm making for my computer science class.
Effectively, this program is designed to analyze a situation within the game of checkers and calculate the optimal decisions to make.
I am using python3 and a text-based terminal interface, though I plan to make a [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) GUI in the future.

## Requirements
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
- Linux or OSX operating system (but it wouldn't be hard to make a windows-functioning version- maybe I'll try that sometime)
- a terminal emulator that supports [ANSI colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)- or else yours and the opponent's pieces are gonna look mighty similar

## Installation
There really is none. It's still in development and i'm not going to set something like that up until I reach a certain stage in production. To test, just download or clone the repository.

## Usage
To use checkers, cd into the folder containing the script and run:
``python3 checkers.py``
You should see something like this:
